# Introduction

tRPC provides an RPC-like client side interface over your existing REST APIs, as well as allowing you define a _separate_ contract implementation rather than going for a 'implementation is the contract' approach, which is best suited for smaller or simpler APIs.

If you have non typescript consumers, a public API, or maybe want to add type safety to your existing REST API? tRPC is what you're looking for!

## Features

- End to end type safety 🛟
- Magic RPC-like API 🪄
- Tiny bundle size 🌟 (1kb!)
- Well-tested and production ready ✅
- No Code Generation 🏃‍♀️
